Plan for Doug
Press button make sound
Choose output device
Playback speed
Main volume
Individual volume
Maybe volume normalisation?
Button to trigger random sound from list


Grid of squares, each square is a separate sound, and has:
    Button to trigger
    Volume
    Playback speed
    Config:
        Title
        Audio file or List of files to pick randomly from (maybe make pick from list of other squares?)
        Keybind
        Repeat mode: Default(Global), Single, Restart, Queued(maybe just queue one extra), Parallel (Not sure if should be in config or on square?)
A plus icon for new squares after the last one
Overall/global options/buttons:
    Volume
    Playback speed
    The output audio device, maybe allow choosing multiple options
    Size scale slider for buttons
    Global Repeat mode
    Stop all
    Cross-fade/fadeout?

Select audio files in situ (Maybe future import/copy them into our own library)


Github actions:
    Compile using pyinstaller:
        https://libtcod.github.io/tutorials/python/2021/distribution.html
        https://data-dive.com/multi-os-deployment-in-cloud-using-pyinstaller-and-github-actions
    Others of interest:
        Manual workflow
        Python package
        Pylint


Maybe take an audio input, such as a mic, and output both to the selected outputs, maybe allow selecting which of the two output to each audio device?
Maybe mess with virtual audio devices? Likely hard..
